Yesterday at [Kate's Blog](https://bandsbandsbandsblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/03/panic-at-the-disco-bbc-radio-1-big-weekend-performance-review/), I was really glad to see the song on their BBC Radio 1 Big Weekend! So I searched Youtube for it! I'd like to say, WOW

BTW, Kate's Blog [One Fall Out At The Disco](https://bandsbandsbandsblog.wordpress.com/) is really my piece of cake and she shares many same thought as mine!

Back to the point, enjoy Urie's Bohemian Rhapsody on his BBC Radio 1 Big Weekend:

The performance above beat this one with most views on the Youtube(Personally, I think Urie sang in a more relaxed way in the one above. Both r fantastic!):
